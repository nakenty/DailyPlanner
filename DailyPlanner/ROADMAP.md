## Quick Start for Developers

### To start developing immediately:

1. **For Backend Development:**
   ```bash
   cd DailyPlanner/WebUI
   dotnet run
   # Visit http://localhost:5000/swagger in Development mode
   ```

2. **For Frontend Development:**
   - Start by creating the Angular app:
     ```bash
     ng new ClientApp --routing --style=scss
     cd ClientApp
     ng serve
     ```

3. **Recommended First Tasks:**
   - Implement persistent storage (start with SQLite for simplicity)
   - Add authentication
   - Build the Angular dashboard

## Technical Decisions Needed

Before proceeding with phases, the team should decide:

1. **Storage Strategy**: OneDrive, Database, or both?
2. **Authentication Provider**: Microsoft Identity, Auth0, or custom?
3. **Frontend Hosting**: Same app (SPA), separate deployment, or both?
4. **Deployment Target**: Cloud (Azure/AWS), on-premise, or desktop?

## Getting Help

- Review existing code in `/Domain`, `/Application`, `/Infrastructure`, `/WebUI`
- Check unit tests in `/DailyPlanner.Tests` for usage examples
- API documentation available at `/swagger` when running in Development mode
- See `README.md` for architecture overview
